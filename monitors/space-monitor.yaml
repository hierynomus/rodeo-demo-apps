      WARNING: Asteroid Rain Detected!

      However, when you look out of the window you see no asteroids at all. You start to wonder whether the Asteroid Detector is actually monitoring the correct planet.

      Go figure out what went wrong with the Asteroid Detector, and why it is detecting asteroids where there are none.

      You might want to start with taking a look at the logs of the Asteroid Detector, and see if there are any hints there.
      And next you might want to take a look at the configuration. Maybe the Asteroid Detector is configured to detect asteroids on the wrong planet.

      Good luck solving this issue while all those sirens are blaring!
